My introductory repository while growing accustomed to GitHub

My name is William Christie. I originally graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder in 12/2014 with a Bachelor's Degree in Integrative Physiology and took a position with Essia Health as a Medical Scribe Trainer with the intent to accumulate clincal hours prior to applying to Medical School. I was contracted to the Rita Bass Trauma Center at Denver Health and worked side by side with physicians during all patient encounters in both emergent and urgent care settings. It was at this point in my career that I was able to witness the tremendous waste in the medical system and the overwhelming need for technological innovation. My wonderful fiance was working as a producer for a Digital Advertising Firm and introduced me to the field of computer science and from that point on I was hooked. I am currently halfway through attaining a second Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder and cannot wait to apply my newfound technical skills to updating our healthcare system and dramatically improve patient healthcare, individual practice and hospital network management, and reducing financial waste via technological improvement from all areas. I hope my GitHub profile will provide a complete overview of the work that I have accomplished to date and look forward to adding future repositories of my achievements.
